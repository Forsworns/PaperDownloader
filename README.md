# PaperDownloader

A crawler downloading papers from NSDI/SIGCOMM/MOBICOM. 

- NSDI presents all of the accepted papers on its website. 
- Most of the Mobicomm papers supply download link. But some of them supply ResearchGate links, which are not considered in the crawler.
- Only part of the Sigcomm papers are OA. But it's hard to login into the ACM as an institution account in crawler.  

The undownloadable papers in Mobicom and Sigcomm will be recorded in the log file.

Notes may be updated on my personal blog in the future (Maybe...)

Todo: Extract paper lists on the conference website and use google scholar to search?
